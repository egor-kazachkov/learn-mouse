# learn-mouse
learn basic mouse usage. For children 2-3 years old

Simple python script with use of Tcl/Tk to help children learn use of mouse in a simple and fun way.

* how to play *
It has two modes: moving and clicking. Script randomly shows an image from a directory. My daughers prefer various animals but could be anything. Image disappear with some "bang!" if child manage to mouse over (for moving mode) or point and click image (for clicking mode).

Caution! With appropriate choice of pictures could be addictive even for adults :)
